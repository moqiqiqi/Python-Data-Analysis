## AirMan-Database-System  
This repository contains the design and implementation of the AirMan System for managing airport operations at London Biggin Hill Airport. It includes an ERD diagram, MySQL scripts for database creation and data population.  

**Background**  
London Biggin Hill Airport has been publicly owned by the London Borough of Bromley since 1974. The airport operates as a public-private partnership, with Biggin Hill Airport Ltd. managing it on a commercial basis since 1994. It specializes in general aviation, serving private aircraft, business jets, and non-commercial flights.

In 2016, the airport gained a boost in commercial potential when Bombardier relocated its European operations there. Additionally, in 2018, funding for the London Aerospace & Technology College and plans for an airport hotel were secured.

Currently, the airportâ€™s operations rely on siloed, outdated systems. To improve efficiency, the CEO commissioned a project to replace these fragmented systems with a unified, modular design. The project aims to streamline core services, including customer parking, security, ground transport, aircraft maintenance, and charter services.

The project involves the development of a new system, with the first module, AirMan, being developed by AirSoft, an Irish software company.

**Project Approach**
Step 1: Creating the ERD Diagram
The first step was to identify the key entities and their attributes based on the project requirements. The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, showing how different entities are related to each other. The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, showing how different entities are related to each other.

Step 2: Implementing the Database in MySQL
With the ERD as a blueprint, the next step was to implement the database schema in MySQL Workbench. This involved creating tables for each entity and defining their relationships.

Example Snippet:
-- Creating PERSON table
CREATE TABLE PERSON (
  PersonID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  AddressLine1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  AddressLine2 VARCHAR(255),
  PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  SocialInsuranceNumber VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE,
  Role ENUM('Customer', 'Pilot', 'Employee') NOT NULL
);

Step 3: Inserting Data
Mock data was inserted into the tables to demonstrate the system's functionality. This data serves as sample records to test and validate the database operations.

Example Snippet:
-- Adding PERSON table data
INSERT INTO PERSON (Name, AddressLine1, PhoneNumber, Email, SocialInsuranceNumber, Role)
VALUES
('John Doe', '123 Aviation Way', '555-1234', 'johndoe@example.com', '123-45-6789', 'Customer'),
('Alice Smith', '234 Skyline Blvd', '555-2345', 'alicesmith@example.com', '987-65-4321', 'Pilot'),
('Bob Johnson', '345 Jetstream St', '555-3456', 'bobjohnson@example.com', '135-79-2468', 'Employee');
