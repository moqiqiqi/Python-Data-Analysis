## UCC projects: 
This folder contains two projects completed during my studies at University College Cork (UCC). Below is a brief introduction to each:

### Data Analysis For the Thesis ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel-217346?style=flat&logo=microsoft-excel&logoColor=white)

For the Collaborative Research Project(thesis), my group conducted interviews to gather qualitative data on our research questions. 
I was responsible for the data analysis portion of the project. My contributions included designing the spreadsheet format for coding the interview transcripts, and then using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, formatting, and analysis, following the principles of thematic analysis.
  
### Business Intelligence and Analytics Assignment ![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-E97627?style=flat&logo=tableau&logoColor=white)

In this project, I analyzed datasets from various streaming platforms to develop insights into the current state of movie and TV streaming. The dataset includes listings from four major platforms—Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime—with details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, and duration. I utilized Tableau to create a dashboard that visualizes these datasets and provides strategic recommendations based on the analysis.
